For InnoDB Performance:
1. innodb_file_per_table = ON
2. innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT (to avoid double buffering)
3. innodb_log_file_size = 256 M is good for most use cases
4. Innodb_log_buffer_size = 4 M is good. but tune if you are handling BLOB data
5. Innodb_buffer_pool_size = allocate 70% - 80% of total memory
6. Innodb_buffer_pool_instances = Min 1 and Max 64
7. Innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2
8. Innodb_thread_concurrency = 2 time number of CPU + number of disk
