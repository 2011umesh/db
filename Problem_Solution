##################Replication Problem##############
note down relay_master_log_file and execute_master_log_position
And then go to master
Show binlog events in "that log" from that position limit 10;
Show binlog events in "mysql-binlog-BI71.032407" from 587094168 limit 10;
Here limit is very important
If you won't give limit server will hang
Limit must
That's matter
And you know about all information_schema tables?
There it will give result table name
In that table we need to check primary key is there or not
If primary key not there means we have to inform respective person. So n so table primary key nog there it causing issue
